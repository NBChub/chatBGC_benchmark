  "answer_sql_LLM": "SELECT * FROM antismash.as_domain_profiles;",
  "answer_summary_LLM": "The antiSMASH database includes various domain profiles, each identified by a unique ID. Key domain profiles include:\n\n- **Beta_elim_lyase**: Beta-eliminating lyase\n- **Condensation**: Multiple types of condensation domains\n- **Epimerization**: Epimerization domain\n- **Transferases**: Various methyl and acyltransferase domains\n- **Aminotransferases**: Classes I to V\n- **Polyketide and NRPS domains**: Including cyclases and docking domains\n- **Transporters**: Acyl-carrier and peptidyl-carrier proteins\n\nOverall, the dataset consists of 58 domain profiles, each with specific functions related to biosynthesis."
