  "answer_summary_LLM": "The antiSMASH dataset shows a diverse genus distribution, with the most prevalent genus being Streptomyces (877 counts), followed by Micromonospora (39) and Kitasatospora (27). Other notable genera include Nocardia (21), Kribbella (11), and Amycolatopsis (8). Several genera have low counts, including Sphaerisporangium, Kineococcus, and others, which each have 1 or 2 counts. Unclassified entries account for 1 count."
