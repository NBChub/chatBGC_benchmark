  "answer_sql_LLM": "SELECT * FROM antismash.as_domain_profiles;",
  "answer_summary_LLM": "The antiSMASH database includes a variety of domain profiles, categorized by type. Key domain profiles include:\n\n1. **Condensation Domains**: Multiple types such as Condensation, Dual, and Starter.\n2. **Transferase Domains**: Including methyl transferases (MT, cMT, oMT, nMT) and adenylation domains (AMP-binding, A-OX).\n3. **Aminotransferase Domains**: Classes I to V.\n4. **Polyketide Synthase Domains**: Including ketosynthase (PKS_KS), ketoreductase (PKS_KR), and acyltransferase (PKS_AT).\n5. **Transporter Domains**: Such as acyl-carrier protein (ACP) and peptidyl-carrier protein (PCP).\n6. **Other Specific Domains**: Including Thioesterase, Heterocyclization, and various hydrolases.\n\nOverall, the dataset encompasses a wide range of functional domains related to biosynthesis in microbial systems."
