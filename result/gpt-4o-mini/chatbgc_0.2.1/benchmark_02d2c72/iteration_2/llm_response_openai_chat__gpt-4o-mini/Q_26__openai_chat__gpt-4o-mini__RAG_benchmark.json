  "answer_summary_LLM": "The data contains information on 11 coding sequences (CDS) located in region 8 of the genome NBC_01571. Each entry includes details such as CDS ID, functional class, locus tag, product, protein ID, translation sequence, and location coordinates. The products range from various proteins like membrane proteins, deacetylases, and hypothetical proteins, with some having specific functions such as protoporphyrinogen oxidase and cell division protein ZapE. The majority of these CDS have an assigned functional class, while a few are marked as hypothetical or without a functional class. The loci are positioned on both the positive and negative strands of the DNA."
