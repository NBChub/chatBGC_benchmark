  "answer_sql_LLM": "SELECT * FROM antismash.as_domain_profiles;",
  "answer_summary_LLM": "The antiSMASH database includes various domain profiles, each identified by a unique ID and characterized by a name and description. Key domain profiles include:\n\n- **Beta_elim_lyase**: Beta-eliminating lyase\n- **Condensation**: Various types of condensation domains (e.g., DCL, LCL, Dual, Starter)\n- **Epimerization**: Epimerization domain\n- **Aminotransferases**: Classes I to V\n- **PKS Domains**: Including Ketosynthase (KS), Ketoreductase (KR), and others\n- **ACPs and Transporters**: Various acyl-carrier and peptidyl-carrier proteins\n- **Specialized Domains**: Such as GNAT, Halogenase, and Fungal nonreducing product template\n\nThere are a total of 58 domain profiles listed in the data."
