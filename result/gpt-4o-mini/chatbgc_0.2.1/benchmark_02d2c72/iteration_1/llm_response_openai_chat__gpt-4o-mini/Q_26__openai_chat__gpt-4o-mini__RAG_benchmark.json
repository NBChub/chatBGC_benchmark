  "answer_summary_LLM": "The data includes 11 coding DNA sequences (CDS) located in region 8 of the genome NBC_01571. Each entry provides details such as CDS ID, functional class ID, locus tag, product name, protein ID, translation sequence, and location within the genome. Notable products include proteins involved in membrane functions, polysaccharide deacetylation, and cell division. The CDS entries vary in the presence of functional class IDs, with some entries marked as hypothetical proteins and others associated with specific protein families. The locations of these CDS range from positions [1553569:1563779] within the genome."
