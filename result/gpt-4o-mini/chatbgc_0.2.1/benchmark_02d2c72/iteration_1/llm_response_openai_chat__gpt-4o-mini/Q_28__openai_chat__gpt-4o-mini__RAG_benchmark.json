  "answer_summary_LLM": "The data contains information on NRPS (Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthetase) regions that include both glycosyltransferase and halogenase SMCOGs. Each entry includes details such as assembly ID, accession number, region number, SMCog ID, description, functional class, locus tag, and associated protein sequences, along with their scores and e-values. There are multiple entries for different NRPS regions, indicating the presence of these functional genes across various assemblies."
