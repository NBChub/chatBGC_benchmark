  "answer_summary_LLM": "The data contains information on 11 coding sequences (CDS) located in region 8 of the genome NBC_01571. Each entry includes details such as the CDS ID, locus tag, product name, protein ID, translation sequence, and location within the genome. Notable products include a membrane protein, a polysaccharide deacetylase, and a cell division protein (ZapE). The majority of the CDS have a functional class ID of 4, indicating they are likely involved in essential biological processes."
