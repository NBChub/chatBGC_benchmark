  "answer_sql_expected": "SELECT * FROM antismash.as_domain_profiles;",
  "answer_summary_expected": "The database contains 58 different domain profiles including Beta-eliminating lyase, various Condensation domains, Glycopeptide-specific NRPS domain, Heterocyclization domain, Epimerization domain, multiple Methyl transferase domains, Adenylation domains, Aminotransferase classes, Ketosynthase domain, Ketoreductase domain, Enoylreductase domain, Dehydrogenase domains, Acyltransferase domain, NRPS COM domains, Polyketide cyclase domains, PKS docking domains, Co-enzyme A ligase domain, Acyl-carrier protein domains, Male sterility protein, branching domain, Formylation domain, FkbH-like domain, GNAT domain, Halogenase domain, Pyran synthase domain, Fungal nonreducing product template domain, NRPS domains, and Phosphatidylglycerol lysyltransferase domain.",
  "answer_sql_LLM": "SELECT * FROM antismash.as_domain_profiles;",
  "answer_summary_LLM": "The antiSMASH database includes various domain profiles, each identified by a unique ID and name. Key domain profiles include condensation domains, methyl transferases, adenylation domains, acyltransferase domains, transporter domains, and several others related to polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. The profiles vary in function, such as lyases, transferases, and cyclases, among others, with descriptions provided for each profile."
