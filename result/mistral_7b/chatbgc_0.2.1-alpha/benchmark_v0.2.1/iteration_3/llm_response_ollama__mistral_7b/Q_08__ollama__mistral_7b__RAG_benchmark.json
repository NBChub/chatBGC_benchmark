  "answer_summary_expected": "The database contains 58 different domain profiles including Beta-eliminating lyase, various Condensation domains, Glycopeptide-specific NRPS domain, Heterocyclization domain, Epimerization domain, multiple Methyl transferase domains, Adenylation domains, Aminotransferase classes, Ketosynthase domain, Ketoreductase domain, Enoylreductase domain, Dehydrogenase domains, Acyltransferase domain, NRPS COM domains, Polyketide cyclase domains, PKS docking domains, Co-enzyme A ligase domain, Acyl-carrier protein domains, Male sterility protein, branching domain, Formylation domain, FkbH-like domain, GNAT domain, Halogenase domain, Pyran synthase domain, Fungal nonreducing product template domain, NRPS domains, and Phosphatidylglycerol lysyltransferase domain.",
  "answer_sql_LLM": "-- Find distinct names of domain profiles\nSELECT DISTINCT name\nFROM antismash.as_domain_profiles",
  "answer_summary_LLM": " The provided DataFrame lists various domain profiles available in the antiSMASH database, which are primarily related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, particularly polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and associated enzymes. Profiles such as Condensation, Epimerization, CAL_domain, SAT, PT, Beta_elim_lyase, Aminotran_, NRPS-COM, PKS_Docking, Polyketide_cyc, and others are included in the list. Each row represents a different domain profile available in the database."
