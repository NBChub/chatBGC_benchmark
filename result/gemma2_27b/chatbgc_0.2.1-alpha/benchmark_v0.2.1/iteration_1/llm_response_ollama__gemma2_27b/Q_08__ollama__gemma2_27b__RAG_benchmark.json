  "answer_sql_expected": "SELECT * FROM antismash.as_domain_profiles;",
  "answer_summary_expected": "The database contains 58 different domain profiles including Beta-eliminating lyase, various Condensation domains, Glycopeptide-specific NRPS domain, Heterocyclization domain, Epimerization domain, multiple Methyl transferase domains, Adenylation domains, Aminotransferase classes, Ketosynthase domain, Ketoreductase domain, Enoylreductase domain, Dehydrogenase domains, Acyltransferase domain, NRPS COM domains, Polyketide cyclase domains, PKS docking domains, Co-enzyme A ligase domain, Acyl-carrier protein domains, Male sterility protein, branching domain, Formylation domain, FkbH-like domain, GNAT domain, Halogenase domain, Pyran synthase domain, Fungal nonreducing product template domain, NRPS domains, and Phosphatidylglycerol lysyltransferase domain.",
  "answer_sql_LLM": "SELECT DISTINCT name FROM antismash.as_domain_profiles",
  "answer_summary_LLM": "The antiSMASH database contains domain profiles for a wide variety of biosynthetic machinery, including those involved in polyketide synthase (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and hybrid pathways.  Specific domains relate to functions like condensation, thioesterase activity, acyl carrier protein binding, ketoreductase activity, and more. \n"
