  "answer_summary_LLM": "The antiSMASH database contains domain profiles for various classes of secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, including polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and hybrid PKS-NRPS systems.  Specific domains identified include those involved in acyl carrier protein (ACP) function, condensation reactions, ketoreductase activity, aminotransferase reactions, and thioesterase domains. \n"
